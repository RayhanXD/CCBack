Despite a growing body of literature, we know little about how these motivational attributes affect a firm’s ability to survive the challenges associated with major industry-level discontinuities. We develop and test theoretical arguments to understand how temporal and regulatory focus affect an organization’s ability to survive a period of industry turbulence. We test our arguments on a unique dataset of 99 Swiss private banks that faced the erosion of banking secrecy during 2007-2016. Our findings support our theorizing that these two motivational attributes impact organizational survival but that their influence evolves over time. Specifically, we find that past focus increases mortality at the inception of uncertainty, but its effect becomes weaker over time. Prevention focus, on the other hand, reduces mortality at the inception of uncertainty. However, its effect also weakens over time and is substituted by promotion focus that helps reduce mortality at later stages of environmental change. Our findings provide novel insights into the temporal patterns of temporal and regulatory foci during discontinuous change and the effects of top management team’s cognition on organizational survival.",Event Topic not found,,,"Tutoring, Uncategorized"
https://calendar.utdallas.edu/event/ancient-echoes-modern-voices-the-crow-collection-goes-beyond,"Arts & Performances,Campus & Community,Lectures & Workshops","The Crow Museum of Asian Art presents Ancient Echoes, Modern Voices: The Crow Collection Goes Beyond, in the new Asian art galleries of the Edith and Peter O'Donnell Jr. Athenaeum Phase I Museum. A seemingly simple phrase, Asian art invokes a complex and unwieldy category. To begin to define this field, Asia can be fixed geographically as it is the largest continent in terms of population and landmass- a region that is about thirty percent of the earth’s total land area. Besides geography, Asia can also be crystallized by its specific traits including language, culture, and history. However, due to shifting geo-political boundaries, its diverse cultures, and diaspora, Asian art is global. Through the founding of this new museum, the Crow collection defines Asia as endlessly diverse, and not of one place, time, or idea.To denote the overlapping circles of meaning, the Crow Galleries are not labeled according to the nation states of China, India, or Japan. Instead, themes that elicit important stories of cross-cultural contact and that are vital to specific Asia’scommunities are foregrounded. The artworks can be considered with these themes in mind or on their own. Through both vantage points, these artworks challenge visitors to contemplate and rethink their relationship to these objects compelling the questions of “what are the stories that are being narrated?” and, “what stories are absent?” Throughout the galleries, visitors and studentsare invited to honor these objects' histories and create new narratives alongside them.","Arts & Culture,Health & Wellness,Campus Life",2024-11-12T11:00:00-06:00,2024-11-12T17:00:00-06:00,"Social, Tutoring"
https://calendar.utdallas.edu/event/the-horror,Arts & Performances,"The HORRORWhat is it about things that go bump in the night that we find so fascinating? Why do people flock to haunted houses and horror movies? From ancient tales of ghosts and demons to Hollywood franchises and creepypasta creations, horror provides an endless wellspring of ways to explore our own mortality and interpret events – both humanmade and unexplainable – that exist outside the norm of rational thought and behavior. In this increasingly unhinged world, horror is often the only way to think through apocalyptic anxieties around a host of issues, such as politics, the environment, generational trauma, body dysmorphia, aging, and, most importantly, death. This fall, the SP/N Gallery presents “The Horror,” an exhibition featuring artists who use the horror genre to disturbing, mystical, romantic and comic effects.Curated by Danielle Avram, SP/N Gallery Director and Brian Scott, SP/N Gallery ManagerExhibition exploring the cultural phenomena of horror.Exhibition includes painting, sculpture, video,new media, and a special film screening.Exhibition: October 11 – November 16, 2024Reception Friday, October 11, 6:30 to 8:30 p.m.Get connected.Join the Bass School mailing list.",Arts & Culture,2024-11-12T11:00:00-06:00,2024-11-12T16:00:00-06:00,Social

A seemingly simple phrase, Asian art invokes a complex and unwieldy category. To begin to define this field, Asia can be fixed geographically as it is the largest continent in terms of population and landmass- a region that is about thirty percent of the earth’s total land area. Besides geography, Asia can also be crystallized by its specific traits including language, culture, and history. However, due to shifting geo-political boundaries, its diverse cultures, and diaspora, Asian art is global. Through the founding of this new museum, the Crow collection defines Asia as endlessly diverse, and not of one place, time, or idea.To denote the overlapping circles of meaning, the Crow Galleries are not labeled according to the nation states of China, India, or Japan. Instead, themes that elicit important stories of cross-cultural contact and that are vital to specific Asia’scommunities are foregrounded. The artworks can be considered with these themes in mind or on their own. Through both vantage points, these artworks challenge visitors to contemplate and rethink their relationship to these objects compelling the questions of “what are the stories that are being narrated?” and, “what stories are absent?” Throughout the galleries, visitors and studentsare invited to honor these objects' histories and create new narratives alongside them.","Arts & Culture,Health & Wellness,Campus Life",2024-11-12T11:00:00-06:00,2024-11-12T17:00:00-06:00,"Social, Tutoring"

https://calendar.utdallas.edu/event/physics-colloquium-prof-mini-das-university-of-houston,Lectures & Workshops,"Single-Photon Spectral Detection and X-Ray Phase ImagingHigh-energy X-ray photons offer unique possibilities in detection, sensing and imaging for a range of applications, including biomedical, materials, defense/security, biophysics and astronomy. However, poor soft tissue contrast and lack of spectroscopic information has limited its applications and benefits. The field is undergoing a new revolution, fueled by X-ray optics, advanced detector technologies and computational methods.This talk will cover X-ray phase imaging methods, spectral imaging methods including spectral computed tomography (CT). Phase imaging methods aim to extract additional contrast by designing systems and methods sensitive to wave nature of light or particles. This allows yielding complete refractive index information of the material. We developed new light transport models as well as designed novel systems that can yield attenuation, phase, dark field and differential phase images in a single shot. These signatures are sensitive to electron density gradients and microstructural variations in the object. Some potential biomedical applications include material classification, microstructure imaging, breast cancer screening, cancer discrimination, classifying microcalcifications in vivo, bone health imaging and digital pathology. Significant prospects also exists for developing new contrast agents and nano materials for signal amplifications in these areas.Advancements in new direct-conversion semiconducting detectors that can count photons while also being sensitive to spectral information and time of arrival have shown to be of significance. I will discuss their potential applications in a range of areas including in medical and industrial imaging. Time permitting, I will also discuss our work on near- and mid-infrared imaging as well as bio-electromagnetism. I will also show how areas of image perception, machine learning and vision science could help advancements in imaging that are now yielding new signals and contrast mechanisms. Throughout the talk, I show how seemingly disparate areas in Physics, Optics and Engineering have historically borrowed concepts from each other and resulted in new interdisciplinary areas.Speaker Bio:Mini Das is Moores Professor of Physics, Biomedical Engineering and Electrical Engineering at the University of Houston (UH).

A seemingly simple phrase, Asian art invokes a complex and unwieldy category. To begin to define this field, Asia can be fixed geographically as it is the largest continent in terms of population and landmass- a region that is about thirty percent of the earth’s total land area. Besides geography, Asia can also be crystallized by its specific traits including language, culture, and history. However, due to shifting geo-political boundaries, its diverse cultures, and diaspora, Asian art is global. Through the founding of this new museum, the Crow collection defines Asia as endlessly diverse, and not of one place, time, or idea.To denote the overlapping circles of meaning, the Crow Galleries are not labeled according to the nation states of China, India, or Japan. Instead, themes that elicit important stories of cross-cultural contact and that are vital to specific Asia’scommunities are foregrounded. The artworks can be considered with these themes in mind or on their own. Through both vantage points, these artworks challenge visitors to contemplate and rethink their relationship to these objects compelling the questions of “what are the stories that are being narrated?” and, “what stories are absent?” Throughout the galleries, visitors and studentsare invited to honor these objects' histories and create new narratives alongside them.","Arts & Culture,Health & Wellness,Campus Life",2024-11-12T11:00:00-06:00,2024-11-12T17:00:00-06:00,"Social, Tutoring"

Our recent work has demonstrated important roles for inhibitory neurons in disorders of brain development, injury and epilepsy. These studies have motivated our ongoing efforts to understand how these cells operate at the synaptic, circuit and behavioral levels and in designing new technologies targeting specific populations of interneurons for therapy. I will discuss our recent efforts examining the role of interneurons in traumatic brain injury and in designing cell transplantation strategies - based on the generation of new inhibitory interneurons - that enable precise manipulation of inhibitory circuits in the injured brain. I will also discuss our ongoing efforts using advanced viral tracing, whole-brain clearing and in vivo physiology to map the structure and function of inhibitory circuits in the rodent brain. By comprehensively mapping the wiring of individual cell types on a global scale, we have uncovered a fundamental strategy to sustain and optimize inhibition following traumatic brain injury that involves spatial reorganization of local and long-range circuit connections across the brain. These recent findings suggest that brain damage, even when focally restricted, likely has a far broader effect on brain-wide neural function than previously appreciated.On November 7, 2024 at 4:00 - 5:00PMIn-person inCRA 12.110.This will also be available onMS Teams.Meeting ID: 252 080 986 226Passcode: C6tVPA","Research,Science & Technology",,,"STEM, Tutoring"

A seemingly simple phrase, Asian art invokes a complex and unwieldy category. To begin to define this field, Asia can be fixed geographically as it is the largest continent in terms of population and landmass- a region that is about thirty percent of the earth’s total land area. Besides geography, Asia can also be crystallized by its specific traits including language, culture, and history. However, due to shifting geo-political boundaries, its diverse cultures, and diaspora, Asian art is global. Through the founding of this new museum, the Crow collection defines Asia as endlessly diverse, and not of one place, time, or idea.To denote the overlapping circles of meaning, the Crow Galleries are not labeled according to the nation states of China, India, or Japan. Instead, themes that elicit important stories of cross-cultural contact and that are vital to specific Asia’scommunities are foregrounded. The artworks can be considered with these themes in mind or on their own. Through both vantage points, these artworks challenge visitors to contemplate and rethink their relationship to these objects compelling the questions of “what are the stories that are being narrated?” and, “what stories are absent?” Throughout the galleries, visitors and studentsare invited to honor these objects' histories and create new narratives alongside them.","Arts & Culture,Health & Wellness,Campus Life",2024-11-12T11:00:00-06:00,2024-11-12T17:00:00-06:00,"Social, Tutoring"

I will present findings on how sleep plays a role in preserving memory and learning as we age. Additionally, I will describe new measures of glymphatic clearance in the human brain using advanced MRI techniques, which enable visualization of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and clearance rates. This emerging imaging technology is beginning to allow us to observe, in vivo, how the glymphatic system may clear neurotoxic substances like amyloid-beta. I will also introduce neuroengineering approaches, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), as potential tools to enhance sleep quality and the various functions it supports. I will also address current limitations of these techniques. Collectively, these insights emphasize the relevance of sleep in healthy aging. They may further open pathways for interventions in the panoply of brain and body diseases and disorders in which sleep is disrupted.On November 8, 2024 at 1:00 - 2:00PMIn-person inCRA 12.110.This will also be available onMS Teams.Meeting ID: 267 042 313 966Passcode: NaPAHm","Research,Science & Technology",,,"STEM, Tutoring"

https://calendar.utdallas.edu/event/unruly-iconography-examining-the-unexpected-in-medieval-art,Arts & Performances,"“Unruly Iconography?” opens a new conversation about medieval images that don’t follow the rules. Speakers will challenge their listeners to rethink the unspoken paradigms that have decided when iconographic motifs should be considered canonical and which are instead “singular,” “exceptional,” or even “mistakes.” They will interrogate the value and limitations of the unspoken binaries that often underlie such labels: tradition versus invention, canon versus exception, or center versus periphery. Their wide-ranging papers will demonstrate the value of a more critically aware, contextually sensitive, and historically informed approach to the study of images and image-making in the Middle Ages. The conference will take place on November 9, 2024 in the Louis A. Simpson Building, A71, at Princeton University. Although the conference will not be recorded, alive stream linkwill provide digital access to those who cannot attend in person. Only those attending on site are asked to register, using the form in the below link.This constitutes the first of two internationally linked conferences, the second of which will be a site-based seminar at the Center for the Art and Architectural History of Port Cities “La Capraia” in Naples in June 2025, which makes southern Italy a laboratory for exploring the relationships between iconography and place within a geographically expanded Middle Ages.

A seemingly simple phrase, Asian art invokes a complex and unwieldy category. To begin to define this field, Asia can be fixed geographically as it is the largest continent in terms of population and landmass- a region that is about thirty percent of the earth’s total land area. Besides geography, Asia can also be crystallized by its specific traits including language, culture, and history. However, due to shifting geo-political boundaries, its diverse cultures, and diaspora, Asian art is global. Through the founding of this new museum, the Crow collection defines Asia as endlessly diverse, and not of one place, time, or idea.To denote the overlapping circles of meaning, the Crow Galleries are not labeled according to the nation states of China, India, or Japan. Instead, themes that elicit important stories of cross-cultural contact and that are vital to specific Asia’scommunities are foregrounded. The artworks can be considered with these themes in mind or on their own. Through both vantage points, these artworks challenge visitors to contemplate and rethink their relationship to these objects compelling the questions of “what are the stories that are being narrated?” and, “what stories are absent?” Throughout the galleries, visitors and studentsare invited to honor these objects' histories and create new narratives alongside them.","Arts & Culture,Health & Wellness,Campus Life",2024-11-12T11:00:00-06:00,2024-11-12T17:00:00-06:00,"Social, Tutoring"

https://calendar.utdallas.edu/event/ancient-echoes-modern-voices-the-crow-collection-goes-beyond,"Arts & Performances,Campus & Community,Lectures & Workshops","The Crow Museum of Asian Art presents Ancient Echoes, Modern Voices: The Crow Collection Goes Beyond, in the new Asian art galleries of the Edith and Peter O'Donnell Jr. Athenaeum Phase I Museum. A seemingly simple phrase, Asian art invokes a complex and unwieldy category. To begin to define this field, Asia can be fixed geographically as it is the largest continent in terms of population and landmass- a region that is about thirty percent of the earth’s total land area. Besides geography, Asia can also be crystallized by its specific traits including language, culture, and history. However, due to shifting geo-political boundaries, its diverse cultures, and diaspora, Asian art is global. Through the founding of this new museum, the Crow collection defines Asia as endlessly diverse, and not of one place, time, or idea.To denote the overlapping circles of meaning, the Crow Galleries are not labeled according to the nation states of China, India, or Japan. Instead, themes that elicit important stories of cross-cultural contact and that are vital to specific Asia’scommunities are foregrounded. The artworks can be considered with these themes in mind or on their own. Through both vantage points, these artworks challenge visitors to contemplate and rethink their relationship to these objects compelling the questions of “what are the stories that are being narrated?” and, “what stories are absent?” Throughout the galleries, visitors and studentsare invited to honor these objects' histories and create new narratives alongside them.","Arts & Culture,Health & Wellness,Campus Life",2024-11-12T11:00:00-06:00,2024-11-12T17:00:00-06:00,"Social, Tutoring"

In this increasingly unhinged world, horror is often the only way to think through apocalyptic anxieties around a host of issues, such as politics, the environment, generational trauma, body dysmorphia, aging, and, most importantly, death.

From ancient tales of ghosts and demons to Hollywood franchises and creepypasta creations, horror provides an endless wellspring of ways to explore our own mortality and interpret events – both humanmade and unexplainable – that exist outside the norm of rational thought and behavior. In this increasingly unhinged world, horror is often the only way to think through apocalyptic anxieties around a host of issues, such as politics, the environment, generational trauma, body dysmorphia, aging, and, most importantly, death. This fall, the SP/N Gallery presents “The Horror,” an exhibition featuring artists who use the horror genre to disturbing, mystical, romantic and comic effects.Curated by Danielle Avram, SP/N Gallery Director and Brian Scott, SP/N Gallery ManagerExhibition exploring the cultural phenomena of horror.Exhibition includes painting, sculpture, video,new media, and a special film screening.Exhibition: October 11 – November 16, 2024Reception Friday, October 11, 6:30 to 8:30 p.m.Get connected.Join the Bass School mailing list.",Arts & Culture,2024-11-12T11:00:00-06:00,2024-11-12T16:00:00-06:00,Social

Through both vantage points, these artworks challenge visitors to contemplate and rethink their relationship to these objects compelling the questions of “what are the stories that are being narrated?” and, “what stories are absent?” Throughout the galleries, visitors and studentsare invited to honor these objects' histories and create new narratives alongside them.","Arts & Culture,Health & Wellness,Campus Life",2024-11-12T11:00:00-06:00,2024-11-12T17:00:00-06:00,"Social, Tutoring"

Increasingly, artists and commissioners look to monuments to function as tools to nourish and strengthen democracies. Given common perceptions of the genre as misused and outdated, this turn towards monuments is both surprising and significant.We treat monuments as materialised acts of cultural memory raised intentionally to influence society. With our current research project, we invite rethinking the place of monuments in contemporary democracies, asking: What do monuments do in democracies, what do those who create and commission them expect of these works, and how do people perceive and react towards them? Most importantly we are interested in exploring how monuments be active tools to make democracies more democratic.This event is free of charge, but registration is requested viathis link.Tanja Schultis an Associate Professor of Art History in the Department of Culture and Aesthetics at Stockholm University, Sweden.

In 1999 attempts to unwrap them were permanently halted, leaving more than four hundred scrolls still unopened.

A seemingly simple phrase, Asian art invokes a complex and unwieldy category. To begin to define this field, Asia can be fixed geographically as it is the largest continent in terms of population and landmass- a region that is about thirty percent of the earth’s total land area. Besides geography, Asia can also be crystallized by its specific traits including language, culture, and history. However, due to shifting geo-political boundaries, its diverse cultures, and diaspora, Asian art is global. Through the founding of this new museum, the Crow collection defines Asia as endlessly diverse, and not of one place, time, or idea.To denote the overlapping circles of meaning, the Crow Galleries are not labeled according to the nation states of China, India, or Japan. Instead, themes that elicit important stories of cross-cultural contact and that are vital to specific Asia’scommunities are foregrounded. The artworks can be considered with these themes in mind or on their own. Through both vantage points, these artworks challenge visitors to contemplate and rethink their relationship to these objects compelling the questions of “what are the stories that are being narrated?” and, “what stories are absent?” Throughout the galleries, visitors and studentsare invited to honor these objects' histories and create new narratives alongside them.","Arts & Culture,Health & Wellness,Campus Life",2024-11-12T11:00:00-06:00,2024-11-12T17:00:00-06:00,"Social, Tutoring"

This fall, the SP/N Gallery presents “The Horror,” an exhibition featuring artists who use the horror genre to disturbing, mystical, romantic and comic effects.Curated by Danielle Avram, SP/N Gallery Director and Brian Scott, SP/N Gallery ManagerExhibition exploring the cultural phenomena of horror.Exhibition includes painting, sculpture, video,new media, and a special film screening.Exhibition: October 11 – November 16, 2024Reception Friday, October 11, 6:30 to 8:30 p.m.Get connected.Join the Bass School mailing list.",Arts & Culture,2024-11-12T11:00:00-06:00,2024-11-12T16:00:00-06:00,Social

https://calendar.utdallas.edu/event/colloquium-and-statistics-seminar-by-dr-ruth-pfeiffer-national-cancer-institute,Lectures & Workshops,"Accommodating population differences in risk prediction model validationStatistical models that predict cancer incidence, recurrence, or mortality following a cancer diagnosis have broad public health and clinical applications. Validation of risk prediction models in independent data provides a rigorous assessment of model performance. However, several differences between the populations that gave rise to the training and the validation data can lead to seemingly poor performance of a risk model. We formalize the notions of “similarity” of the training and validation data and define reproducibility and transportability. We address the impact of different predictor distributions and differences in verifying the outcome on model calibration, accuracy and discrimination. When individual level data from both the training and validation data sets are available, we propose and study weighted versions of the validation metrics that adjust for differences in the predictor distributions and in outcome verification to provide a more comprehensive assessment of model performance. We give conditions on the model and the training and validation populations that ensure a model's reproducibility or transportability and show how to check them. As an illustration we develop and validate a prostate cancer risk model using data from two large North American prostate cancer prevention trials, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) and Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening trials.",Science & Technology,2024-11-15T15:00:00-06:00,2024-11-15T16:00:00-06:00,"STEM, Tutoring"

https://calendar.utdallas.edu/event/ancient-echoes-modern-voices-the-crow-collection-goes-beyond,"Arts & Performances,Campus & Community,Lectures & Workshops","The Crow Museum of Asian Art presents Ancient Echoes, Modern Voices: The Crow Collection Goes Beyond, in the new Asian art galleries of the Edith and Peter O'Donnell Jr. Athenaeum Phase I Museum. A seemingly simple phrase, Asian art invokes a complex and unwieldy category. To begin to define this field, Asia can be fixed geographically as it is the largest continent in terms of population and landmass- a region that is about thirty percent of the earth’s total land area. Besides geography, Asia can also be crystallized by its specific traits including language, culture, and history. However, due to shifting geo-political boundaries, its diverse cultures, and diaspora, Asian art is global. Through the founding of this new museum, the Crow collection defines Asia as endlessly diverse, and not of one place, time, or idea.To denote the overlapping circles of meaning, the Crow Galleries are not labeled according to the nation states of China, India, or Japan. Instead, themes that elicit important stories of cross-cultural contact and that are vital to specific Asia’scommunities are foregrounded. The artworks can be considered with these themes in mind or on their own. Through both vantage points, these artworks challenge visitors to contemplate and rethink their relationship to these objects compelling the questions of “what are the stories that are being narrated?” and, “what stories are absent?” Throughout the galleries, visitors and studentsare invited to honor these objects' histories and create new narratives alongside them.","Arts & Culture,Health & Wellness,Campus Life",2024-11-12T11:00:00-06:00,2024-11-12T17:00:00-06:00,"Social, Tutoring"

A seemingly simple phrase, Asian art invokes a complex and unwieldy category. To begin to define this field, Asia can be fixed geographically as it is the largest continent in terms of population and landmass- a region that is about thirty percent of the earth’s total land area. Besides geography, Asia can also be crystallized by its specific traits including language, culture, and history. However, due to shifting geo-political boundaries, its diverse cultures, and diaspora, Asian art is global. Through the founding of this new museum, the Crow collection defines Asia as endlessly diverse, and not of one place, time, or idea.To denote the overlapping circles of meaning, the Crow Galleries are not labeled according to the nation states of China, India, or Japan. Instead, themes that elicit important stories of cross-cultural contact and that are vital to specific Asia’scommunities are foregrounded. The artworks can be considered with these themes in mind or on their own. Through both vantage points, these artworks challenge visitors to contemplate and rethink their relationship to these objects compelling the questions of “what are the stories that are being narrated?” and, “what stories are absent?” Throughout the galleries, visitors and studentsare invited to honor these objects' histories and create new narratives alongside them.","Arts & Culture,Health & Wellness,Campus Life",2024-11-12T11:00:00-06:00,2024-11-12T17:00:00-06:00,"Social, Tutoring"

The observed properties of this aged, massive and relatively nearby RSG include a space velocity teetering in the verge of ""runaway star"" values, and a much debated potentially high surface rotation as well as intriguing long-term variability patters and sudden dimming events. The debate is still on whether Betelgeuse is actually a rapid rotator or if we are fooled by large-scale convective motions on its surface, but the former possibility requires a serendipitous sequence of events to be explained. In this talk I will review the latest developments on Betelgeuse including contributions from our group at LSU, mainly the idea that Betelgeuse may have suffered a past merger with a smaller companion leading to it's spin-up but also its apparent surface nitrogen enrichment.","Research,Science & Technology",2024-11-20T16:00:00-06:00,2024-11-20T17:00:00-06:00,"STEM, Tutoring"

https://calendar.utdallas.edu/event/ancient-echoes-modern-voices-the-crow-collection-goes-beyond,"Arts & Performances,Campus & Community,Lectures & Workshops","The Crow Museum of Asian Art presents Ancient Echoes, Modern Voices: The Crow Collection Goes Beyond, in the new Asian art galleries of the Edith and Peter O'Donnell Jr. Athenaeum Phase I Museum. A seemingly simple phrase, Asian art invokes a complex and unwieldy category. To begin to define this field, Asia can be fixed geographically as it is the largest continent in terms of population and landmass- a region that is about thirty percent of the earth’s total land area. Besides geography, Asia can also be crystallized by its specific traits including language, culture, and history. However, due to shifting geo-political boundaries, its diverse cultures, and diaspora, Asian art is global. Through the founding of this new museum, the Crow collection defines Asia as endlessly diverse, and not of one place, time, or idea.To denote the overlapping circles of meaning, the Crow Galleries are not labeled according to the nation states of China, India, or Japan. Instead, themes that elicit important stories of cross-cultural contact and that are vital to specific Asia’scommunities are foregrounded. The artworks can be considered with these themes in mind or on their own. Through both vantage points, these artworks challenge visitors to contemplate and rethink their relationship to these objects compelling the questions of “what are the stories that are being narrated?” and, “what stories are absent?” Throughout the galleries, visitors and studentsare invited to honor these objects' histories and create new narratives alongside them.","Arts & Culture,Health & Wellness,Campus Life",2024-11-12T11:00:00-06:00,2024-11-12T17:00:00-06:00,"Social, Tutoring"

However, the influence of interoception on the disease state remains inconclusive, with the existing literature showing mixed results. In a sample of 86 participants, we compared schizophrenia to healthy controls on interoceptive accuracy and interoceptive sensibility in relation to common symptoms, social functioning, and emotional recognition. The results of this study offer only limited evidence for interoceptive accuracy impairments in schizophrenia, but do support impairments in interoceptive sensitivity. Further, we found no significant relationship between interoceptive accuracy and emotional recognition. Difficulties in interception may relate to the self-disturbances that are common in schizophrenia and will require further investigation to further explore these relationships.This talk is in-person in JO 4.306.Light snacks will be provided.","Research,Science & Technology",2024-11-21T11:30:00-06:00,2024-11-21T12:30:00-06:00,"STEM, Tutoring"

Many firms now espouse a commitment to the environment or to certain social values, but there is little empirical evidence as to whether this discourse materially alters other political strategies and behaviors. This study examines the alignment between firms’ discourse on environmental and social issues and their political lobbying on the same issues. Our research circumvents empirical constraints in observing the directionality of lobbying activities by focusing on five U.S. states that require firms to disclose their lobbying stances. Our findings indicate a general lack of positive correlation between firms’ discourse (i.e., talk) and their lobbying (i.e., walk) on environmental and social issues. However, governance policies mandating board oversight of political activities and transparency of lobbying enhance alignment between talk and walk. We further explore how characteristics of board composition influence decision-making. These results highlight the importance of the coordinated governance and transparency of corporate political activity for stakeholder relations and accountable capitalism.",Event Topic not found,2024-11-22T10:00:00-06:00,2024-11-22T11:30:00-06:00,"Tutoring, Uncategorized"

A seemingly simple phrase, Asian art invokes a complex and unwieldy category. To begin to define this field, Asia can be fixed geographically as it is the largest continent in terms of population and landmass- a region that is about thirty percent of the earth’s total land area. Besides geography, Asia can also be crystallized by its specific traits including language, culture, and history. However, due to shifting geo-political boundaries, its diverse cultures, and diaspora, Asian art is global. Through the founding of this new museum, the Crow collection defines Asia as endlessly diverse, and not of one place, time, or idea.To denote the overlapping circles of meaning, the Crow Galleries are not labeled according to the nation states of China, India, or Japan. Instead, themes that elicit important stories of cross-cultural contact and that are vital to specific Asia’scommunities are foregrounded. The artworks can be considered with these themes in mind or on their own. Through both vantage points, these artworks challenge visitors to contemplate and rethink their relationship to these objects compelling the questions of “what are the stories that are being narrated?” and, “what stories are absent?” Throughout the galleries, visitors and studentsare invited to honor these objects' histories and create new narratives alongside them.","Arts & Culture,Health & Wellness,Campus Life",2024-11-12T11:00:00-06:00,2024-11-12T17:00:00-06:00,"Social, Tutoring"

https://calendar.utdallas.edu/event/pseudo-static-storage-circuits-for-extreme-low-voltage-cryo-cmos-applications-by-professor-jaydeep-kulkarni-ut-austin,Lectures & Workshops,"Abstract: Cryogenic logic technology has emerged as a promising candidate for power-efficient High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems thanks to steeper subthreshold swing, extremely low leakage, enhanced mobility, low interconnect resistance, and improved reliability at cryogenic temperatures. Monolithically integrated, low-latency, and large-capacity on-chip memory operating reliably at cryogenic conditions is essential to circumvent memory wall issues. Furthermore, an ultra-low-voltage operation is necessary to minimize power consumption and offset the cooling cost overheads. This seminar will motivate the exploration of cryogenic computing and recent advances in low-voltage logic and memory innovations.Dynamic random-access memories (DRAM), which offer higher density and lower static power, are being explored to realize high-density embedded memories, as the retention time of the DRAM bitcells improves by several orders due to extremely low leakage at cryogenic temperatures, making them pseudo-static. Moreover, lower leakage also enables multi-level cell operation, improving the bitcell density. Amongst the potential candidates for cryo-cache, capacitor-less single transistor DRAM (1T-DRAM) bitcells show a lot of promise in constructing scalable memory systems by eliminating the need for a dedicated capacitor and offering improved capacity.  Among the capacitor-less DRAMs, gated thyristor-based capacitor-less DRAM (TRAM) provides a large ON/OFF ratio and a non-destructive read, which enables a fast read-write speed and lower operating voltage as the write mechanism is bipolar injection.  In this seminar, I shall present the potential of TRAM as a low-voltage, dense, and fast alternative for cryogenic embedded DRAM applications.The low leakage current attribute can be extended to logic circuits such as latches and flip-flops. I will present the concept of a pseudo-static flip-flop design is also discussed, which offers a 50% reduction in clock power, 20% savings in the area, and >1ms of refresh time at cryogenic temperature.  I will conclude the seminar with the prospects and challenges in cryogenic logic, memory devices, and circuit explorations.Bio:Jaydeep Kulkarnigraduated from Purdue University with a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

A seemingly simple phrase, Asian art invokes a complex and unwieldy category. To begin to define this field, Asia can be fixed geographically as it is the largest continent in terms of population and landmass- a region that is about thirty percent of the earth’s total land area. Besides geography, Asia can also be crystallized by its specific traits including language, culture, and history. However, due to shifting geo-political boundaries, its diverse cultures, and diaspora, Asian art is global. Through the founding of this new museum, the Crow collection defines Asia as endlessly diverse, and not of one place, time, or idea.To denote the overlapping circles of meaning, the Crow Galleries are not labeled according to the nation states of China, India, or Japan. Instead, themes that elicit important stories of cross-cultural contact and that are vital to specific Asia’scommunities are foregrounded. The artworks can be considered with these themes in mind or on their own. Through both vantage points, these artworks challenge visitors to contemplate and rethink their relationship to these objects compelling the questions of “what are the stories that are being narrated?” and, “what stories are absent?” Throughout the galleries, visitors and studentsare invited to honor these objects' histories and create new narratives alongside them.","Arts & Culture,Health & Wellness,Campus Life",2024-11-12T11:00:00-06:00,2024-11-12T17:00:00-06:00,"Social, Tutoring"

A seemingly simple phrase, Asian art invokes a complex and unwieldy category. To begin to define this field, Asia can be fixed geographically as it is the largest continent in terms of population and landmass- a region that is about thirty percent of the earth’s total land area. Besides geography, Asia can also be crystallized by its specific traits including language, culture, and history. However, due to shifting geo-political boundaries, its diverse cultures, and diaspora, Asian art is global. Through the founding of this new museum, the Crow collection defines Asia as endlessly diverse, and not of one place, time, or idea.To denote the overlapping circles of meaning, the Crow Galleries are not labeled according to the nation states of China, India, or Japan. Instead, themes that elicit important stories of cross-cultural contact and that are vital to specific Asia’scommunities are foregrounded. The artworks can be considered with these themes in mind or on their own. Through both vantage points, these artworks challenge visitors to contemplate and rethink their relationship to these objects compelling the questions of “what are the stories that are being narrated?” and, “what stories are absent?” Throughout the galleries, visitors and studentsare invited to honor these objects' histories and create new narratives alongside them.","Arts & Culture,Health & Wellness,Campus Life",2024-11-12T11:00:00-06:00,2024-11-12T17:00:00-06:00,"Social, Tutoring"

Preclinical studies have shown recovery is optimal when moderate VNS is paired with rehabilitation in interstimulus intervals of 10 seconds and is ineffective when unpaired. Further studies showed pairing VNS deliveries with rehab events in intervals of 2 seconds results in no recovery.  Participants in ongoing clinical trials recover from interleaving VNS and rehab pairings to the same degree seen preclinically with 10 second VNS paired rehab intervals. These differences led us to question whether the interstimulus intervals between rehab events or between VNS deliveries are influencing the biological mechanisms promoting recovery. Here we explore if the intervals of rehab events between VNS deliveries influence recovery by increasing rehab to intervals of 2 seconds with 10 second VNS intervals in a sensory deficit animal model. The results will help us understand why intervals of 2 second VNS paired rehab events failed while success is seen in clinical trials with interleaved pairings. We have demonstrated feasibility in delivering rehab every 2 seconds and VNS deliveries every 10 seconds. Animals at the post-injury time point are exhibiting sensory deficit phenotypes consistent with the preceding studies. By investigating the interstimulus intervals required for recovery, we will gain further understanding of the biological mechanisms that are influenced by VNS paired rehabilitation.On December 4, 2024 at 1:30 - 2:00PMIn-person inCRA 12.110.This will also be available onMS Teams.Meeting ID: 286 858 127 562Passcode: 7bTV8G","Research,Science & Technology",2024-12-04T16:30:00-06:00,2024-12-04T17:00:00-06:00,"STEM, Tutoring"

The current research uses data from a 4-year longitudinal study (average n = 388 across 8 waves) to investigate how different categories of major life goals systematically change in their importance during the course of undergraduate education. Goals were measured at each of the 8 waves using a shortened version of the Major Life Goals Scale with a 5-point Likert scale response format. Linear growth models were specified using Multilevel Modeling with Restricted Maximum Likelihood estimation in SPSS, and it was found that the importance of all major life goals significantly decreased over time. These general declines are reminiscent of trends present in previous studies into goal importance (Atherton et al., 2021; Roberts et al., 2004). This trend of an overall decrease in goal importance over time will be discussed in the context of goal selection behaviors across development.This talk is in-person in JO 4.306.Light snacks will be provided.","Research,Science & Technology",2024-12-05T11:30:00-06:00,2024-12-05T12:30:00-06:00,"STEM, Tutoring"

A seemingly simple phrase, Asian art invokes a complex and unwieldy category.

Besides geography, Asia can also be crystallized by its specific traits including language, culture, and history. However, due to shifting geo-political boundaries, its diverse cultures, and diaspora, Asian art is global. Through the founding of this new museum, the Crow collection defines Asia as endlessly diverse, and not of one place, time, or idea.To denote the overlapping circles of meaning, the Crow Galleries are not labeled according to the nation states of China, India, or Japan. Instead, themes that elicit important stories of cross-cultural contact and that are vital to specific Asia’scommunities are foregrounded. The artworks can be considered with these themes in mind or on their own. Through both vantage points, these artworks challenge visitors to contemplate and rethink their relationship to these objects compelling the questions of “what are the stories that are being narrated?” and, “what stories are absent?” Throughout the galleries, visitors and studentsare invited to honor these objects' histories and create new narratives alongside them.","Arts & Culture,Health & Wellness,Campus Life",2024-11-12T11:00:00-06:00,2024-11-12T17:00:00-06:00,"Social, Tutoring"

However, there is an ongoing crisis regarding excessive opiate usage that can lead to adverse side effects, therefore, the search for alternative analgesics is critically urgent. Scientists have discovered that the Sigma-2 receptor, later identified as being identical to the transmembrane protein, TMEM97, could reduce mechanical hypersensitivity in rodent models when the receptor is inhibited. Previous studies have observed that the presence of TMEM97 is necessary for the ligand FEM-1689 to produce anti-nociceptive effects in a Spared Nerve Injury model. We have collected marine cyanobacteria compounds, known as the veraguamides, that have shown non-toxic affinity to TMEM97 in non-cancerous cells, and have shown potential to be used as alternative analgesics to opiates. To test the sensitivity and efficacy of our analgesics, we utilized a Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) inflammatory paw injury model in both female and male adult wildtype mice, which possess the TMEM97 protein. Mechanical hypersensitivity was assessed using a 50% withdrawal latency von Frey test throughout various time points per experimental group. With this model, we observed the analgesic efficacy of three analogs of Veraguamide, FEM-1689, and a negative control, post-CFA injury. We found that veraguamides demonstrate a small ability to reduce mechanical hypersensitivity in wildtype mice. With these findings, we can further understand the role of TMEM97 in treating inflammatory pain with novel analgesics. Future studies will test the efficacy of veraguamides in TMEM97 knockout mice to understand the role of TMEM97 in pain targeting.On December 9, 2024 at 1:00 - 1:30PMIn-person inCRA 12.110.This will also be available onMS Teams.Meeting ID: 269 223 059 147Passcode: xAAaar","Research,Science & Technology",2024-12-09T13:00:00-06:00,2024-12-09T13:30:00-06:00,"STEM, Tutoring"

However, simple comparisons of protein sequences are often insufficient to inform biocatalyst discovery and design, but can now be augmented through the establishment of structural modeling workflows that provide “structural annotation” and hypothesis generation to inform strategies for ancestral resurrection in the search for optimal biocatalytic enzymes. Focusing on design questions centered around a family of fungal flavin mono-oxygenases, I will present a novel application of large-scale structure prediction through a pipeline based on AlphaFold2 together with cofactor modeling, substrate docking and machine learning to identify key residues controlling site-specific and stereo-selective asymmetric dearomatization reactions. I will discuss the pipeline we established and illustrate how we are using the structurally annotated ancestral tree to explore and inform mutational studies and prioritization of ancestral sequence resurrection for purposes of establishing a broadly substrate scoped biocatalyst.",Research,2025-02-09T15:30:00-06:00,2025-02-09T17:00:00-06:00,"STEM, Tutoring"

Bait theory studies these impulses across the arts, humanities, biology, and technology. Rooted in a combination of information theory and behavioral science, it explores the interaction between organisms, stimuli, and responses, seeking patterns in emotions, kinetics, and physiology. Historically, bait applications trace back to early communities where human connections relied on a ""network of obligation:” individuals sharing resources and knowledge. Care and general aid thus play a significant role in bait theory.RAW 2025 presentsbaitandaidas complementary concepts providing a compelling framework for addressing both the risks and opportunities posed by emerging technological tools.
