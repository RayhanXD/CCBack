What metrics define the ""targets"" of economic development strategies? What comprises success? What evidence lends support and encouragement for such efforts? Using selected case studies of economic development projects and programs, we will evaluate available evidence for indications of the success with which economic development efforts have achieved their intended goals. Finally, we will explore the prospects for a re-imagined economic development toolkit oriented less to rejuvenate and restore past capabilities and more to facilitate the transit to new roles and opportunities.

The final section of the course investigates sovereign debt and lending. Within these broad topics we will ask and answer questions such as ""What factors explain how stock markets respond to political events?"", ""How do political institutions shape the decision of firms to issue equity rather than use banks?"", ""Why did investors loose confidence in Thailand's currency but not Vietnam?"", and ""Why did Argentina decide to default on its debt while neighboring Brazil did not?""

These recommendations are often client-oriented; pertinent to public decisions; contextual to time/place/culture; and influenced by key social values and political processes. Policy analysis is a tool to better identify and understand"," 1) different points of view of a policy problem, 2) potential options for solving (or at least minimizing the negative effects) of the issue, 3) important steps and actors necessary to make change, and 4) the related probable outcomes, consequences, and uncertainties.

Good policy making can improve society and the quality of life of people, especially those who are in most need. But when done poorly, policies can just as easily injure individuals and groups, strip them of their rights, dignity, and quality of life, all the while benefiting a select few.
